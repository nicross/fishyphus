# TODO
Items intended to be addressed before the jam ends:

- Monster music
  - Evolving pads forming a triad with the bass

## Other interactions
There's a lot of time left in the jam to add interesting mechanics.
Some ideas:

### Throwing back fish
- Score as inventory
- Attracts the monster temporarily
- Possibly moving down or away
- Bonuses
  - Fish life
  - Fish speed

### Depth charges
- Acquired after significant high scores
- Deals actual damage
- Monster dies after three hits, with respawn timer
- Bonuses
  - Depth charge count
  - Depth charge damage
  - Depth charge range
