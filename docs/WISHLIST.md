# WISHLIST
Items that _could be_ cool, but greatly expand the scope:

## Sea gulls
Occasionally the sailor will be joined by a sea gull.
Perhaps they may encounter dolphins too?

## Other interactions
The only interaction is fishing.
Could players get more choice with these additional interactions?
